# Diabetes_Prediction
Diabetic Prediction Project

#**Project Goal:** Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes development based on patient characteristics and medical history.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy.



**Task:**
- **Binary classification**: Predict whether an individual will develop diabetes (1) or not (0)



#**Step 1: Data Collection**
           - Collect a dataset containing relevant patient information, such as:
              Age,	Gender,	Polyuria,	Polydipsia,	sudden weight loss,	weakness,	Polyphagia,	Genital thrush,	visual blurring,	Itching,	Irritability,	delayed healing,	partial paresis,	 
              muscle stiffness,	Alopecia,	Obesity.


  
**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**
        - Clean and preprocess the dataset:
             - we have clean dataset
             - Convert categorical variables into numerical variables



             
**Step 3: Feature Selection**
       - Select relevant features to use in the model:
           - Identify correlations between features and diabetes


           
**Step 4: Model Selection**
       - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm:
           - Classification algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neigbour, Naive bayes)


           
**Step 5: Model Training**
       - Train the model using the selected features and algorithm:
           - Split the dataset into training and testing sets


           
**Step 6: Model Evaluation**
       - Evaluate the performance of the model:
           - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
           - Compare the performance of different models
